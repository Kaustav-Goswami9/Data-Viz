- The "Never Votes" category has more representation among those who lost their job than among those who didn't.

- The highest confidence is in "In-person voting machines," where the majority, over 70%, are either "Very confident" or "Somewhat confident."
- Similarly, "In-person paper ballots" also have a high level of confidence, with a significant portion of respondents being "Very confident."
- The confidence levels drop significantly for "Mailed paper ballots" and "Electronic votes submitted online."
- "Mailed paper ballots" have a larger portion of respondents who are "Not very confident" and "Not at all confident" compared to the in-person methods.

## **Topic-6:**
- The majority of respondents who "Always" vote in union elections do not participate in community activities, indicating a significant proportion of individuals who are politically active in union matters but not necessarily engaged in broader community activities.
- Number of individuals who participate in community activities also "Always" vote, showing that community engagement and consistent voting are correlated for a considerable segment of the population.
- For categories like "Sometimes" and "Rarely" voting, the count of individuals who do not participate in community activities remains higher. This trend suggests that lack of community engagement is associated with lower voting frequency.
- The "Don't vote" category is dominated by individuals who do not participate in community activities. This highlights that non-participation in community activities may correlate with a higher likelihood of abstaining from voting.
