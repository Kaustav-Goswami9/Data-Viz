## **Topic-1: Age Group Distribution vs Voter Category**
### **Summary:**
- Majority of all age groups consistently vote, with "Always Votes" being the dominant category.
- Senior Adults are the most consistent voters; Young Adults are the least.
- Young Adults have a higher proportion of non-voters or rare voters, indicating lower engagement.
- Middle-aged Adults have high consistent voter numbers but still show a mix of inconsistent voters.

### **Detailed:**
- The majority of individuals across all age groups fall into the "Always Votes" category, indicating a general tendency towards regular voting behavior. The height of the "Always Votes" section is significantly higher in all age groups compared to other categories.
- Senior Adults are more likely to always vote compared to the other two age groups. Young Adults have the lowest number of consistent voters.
- Young Adults have a higher proportion of people who either never vote or rarely vote compared to the older age groups. This suggests a potential lack of engagement in the electoral process among younger individuals.
- The Middle-aged Adults group seems to be a transitional phase where the number of consistent voters is high, but there is still a noticeable percentage of individuals who are not as consistent.

- "Mailed paper ballots" have a larger portion of respondents who are "Not very confident" and "Not at all confident" compared to the in-person methods.

## **Topic-6: Effect of Community Engagement on Voting in Union Elections (Category-1: Community Engagement and Participation)**
### **Summary:**
- Most frequent union voters often don't engage in community activities.
- Community involvement correlates with consistent voting for many.
- Less frequent voters show lower community engagement overall.
- Non-voters are equally split between those who do and don't participate in community activities.

### **Detailed:**
- The majority of respondents who "Always" vote in union elections do not participate in community activities, indicating a significant proportion of individuals who are politically active in union matters but not necessarily engaged in broader community activities.
- Number of individuals who participate in community activities also "Always" vote, showing that community engagement and consistent voting are correlated for a considerable segment of the population.
- For categories like "Sometimes" and "Rarely" voting, the count of individuals who do not participate in community activities remains high, but considerably lower compared to "Always" voting category. This trend suggests that lack of community engagement is associated with lower voting frequency.
- The "Don't vote" category is dominated by individuals who do and do not participate in community activities. Thus highlighting almost equal representation.
